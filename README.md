# IoTDataAnalysis
This repository is about making a matlab code to analyse IoT data from a parse-server.
It is part of a bigger project.

To run this code, it's necesary to install jsonlab (toolbox).
To install it, first, you need to type "pathtool" in the command window of Matlab,
browse to the jsonlab root folder and add to the list, then click "Save".
Then, run "rehash" in the command window of MATLAB, and type "which loadjson", if you see an
output, that means JSONlab is installed.

If the previous steps didn't work, you only need to copy all the ".m" files of jsonlab in the same folder where the IoTDataAnalysis files are.
